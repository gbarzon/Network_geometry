########## TODO ##########

V parameter "perturbation_strength" is not needed when computing the jacobian
V check if normalization is correct, i.e., total number of node couples -> N(N-1)/2
V comparison diffusion distance - jacobian distance
V create functions for plotting (instead of copy and paste)
V show inter- vs intra- cluster distance
V varying parameters in a grid
V Implement hierarchical clustering
V Show dendrogram beside average distance matrix
V Compute Mantel test btw different average matrices
V Simulating diffusion distance with different parameters
    -> if normalized, it seems independent of A -> maybe A related to decay (indeed A do not depend on topology)

* Plot also normalized matrix over times -> check if they are similar
* Plot eigenvalues of jacobian

* Plot everything with sns
 (also Brockmann and Barzel distances) ???
* Define a characteristic time, in order to sample
i.e. -) relaxation time -) norm of jacobian
check also paper "Multiscale Information Propagation in Emergent Functional Networks"
* Try hierarchical clustering for different ratio in GN network (see suppl mat)
* Move from networkx to igraph
* Simulate on connectome


??????????? QUESTIONS ???????????

- Non sarebbe meglio usare la stessa notazione dei previous paper, i.e., row vector instead of column vector??
- Generalized diffusion equation

- Qual Ã¨ il tempo caratteristico di una dinamica diffusiva wrt dinamica jacobiana?
- Dinamica neuronale: what happens?
- Paragonare diffusion vs jacobian distance
- Correlare classificazione di Barzel, come lui classifica i modelli


# option (i)
- try with mean-field
- try with annealed approximation

# option (ii)
- like diffusion: simulate the dynamics of N random walker starting from node i, count how many reach node j after T steps
-> from diffusion equation to transition prob matrix, we can do the same with the jacobian
